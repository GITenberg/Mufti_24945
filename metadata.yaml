description: In a town called Poperinghe, during the height of the German offensive
  in May 1918, quartermaster-sergeant, Derek Vane, watches with mixed feelings as
  a pilot and his observer are shot down. This penetrating story, which takes us through
  to the end of the war, was written by a man who experienced it all.
